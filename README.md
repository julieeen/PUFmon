## PUFMon: Security Monitoring of FPGAs using Physically Unclonable Functions

The PUFMon project aims to secure embedded devices against physical attacks using active evaluation of intrinsic secure PUFs. It is an open, alternative implementation different to current industry approaches like Xilinx's SecMon, Alteraâ€™s SSIP or Microsemi's EnforcIT.

Further interested people might want to read our [published paper](Docu/Paper.pdf), [talk](/Docu/Talk.pdf) or [thesis](Docu/Thesis.pdf).

Anyone else will find here many popular PUF implementations :)
